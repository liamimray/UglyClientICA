## Weaknesses in Current Design and Implementation
1. **Tight Coupling**: The current implementation may have direct dependencies between classes, making it difficult to modify or extend functionality without affecting other parts of the system.
2. **Lack of Abstraction**: If concrete classes are used instead of interfaces or abstract classes, it limits flexibility and reusability.
3. **Code Duplication**: Repeated logic across classes can lead to maintenance challenges and increased risk of bugs.
4. **Violation of Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Classes may be handling multiple responsibilities, making them harder to test and maintain.
5. **Inconsistent Interfaces**: If external systems or libraries are integrated, their interfaces may not align with the internal system, leading to cumbersome and error-prone code.

## Possible Improvements
1. **Introduce Abstraction**: Use interfaces or abstract classes to define contracts for key components. This will decouple the implementation from the interface, improving flexibility.
2. **Implement the Adapter Pattern**: Create adapter classes to bridge mismatched interfaces between the system and external libraries or components.
3. **Encapsulate Behavior**: Refactor classes to ensure each class has a single responsibility, adhering to SRP.
4. **Promote Reusability**: Extract common logic into utility classes or shared components to reduce duplication.
5. **Dependency Injection**: Use dependency injection to manage dependencies, improving testability and reducing tight coupling.

## Abstract Classes and Interfaces
- **Abstract Classes**: Define base classes for shared behavior, such as `BaseClientAdapter` for common adapter logic.
- **Interfaces**: Define contracts for key components, such as `IClientService` for client-related operations or `ILogger` for logging functionality.
